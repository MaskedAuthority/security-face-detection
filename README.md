# Security Face Detection

**Security Face Detection** is a face recognition system built using MediaPipe's FaceMesh technology. It captures and processes facial landmarks to create unique face signatures, which are then matched for authentication or identification purposes. The system is designed to offer a reliable method for real-time face recognition using webcam input.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
- Pickle (for storing/loading face signatures)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/security-face-detection.git
   cd security-face-detection

## How to Use

### Step 1: Create and Store a Face Signature
Before you can match faces, you need to create and store a face signature:
you can create a face signature by running python create_face.py  let it run for 10 sec then  ctrl c 

 **step 2 running the actull face detection:**
